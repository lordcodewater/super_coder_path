##syntax for swift
objects are all in heap;
no garbage collection in swift, it use pointer counter to detect object without reference;
strong typed;
almost all varible are optional like string?  when not set: nil, set: string;
all attributes varibles should be initialized in initializer or assigned when u define it in the class body;

## codes sample to remember
var name: type = xxxx
let digit  /*  constant */

class viewController: UIViewController{
    let digit 
}
